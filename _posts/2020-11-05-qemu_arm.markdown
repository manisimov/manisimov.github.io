## Static and dynamic libraries

As I understood, QEMU (user-space QEMU, e.g. `qemu-arm` from `qemu-user` package) requires dynamicaly linked libraries for the target architecture installed on the host. 

There is possibility to link all libraries statically and run it with `qemu-arm-static` from `qemu-user-static` debian package.

gcc flag `-static` is used to make statically linked binary.


## Cross compilation

    arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-8 -g3 -static mess.c -march=armv8-a -o mess

## Debugging

Start process on the cortex-a7 emulator and open GDB server on port 1234:

    qemu-arm-static -g 1234 mess -cpu cortex-a7
    
Attach gdb:
    
    gdb-multiarch
    
    > file mess
    > target remote localhost:1234
    > b main
    > c
    > next
    ...
